#About
Extip simply prints your external IP address to the terminal.

It functions similarly to ```# curl ifcofig.me``` or ```# curl ipecho.net/plain```
except it checks both (in case one is down) and in the case
of ```ipecho.net/plain```, it adds a newline to the end.

#Installation
Run

```$ python3 setup.py install```

#Usage
Simply run

```# extip```
